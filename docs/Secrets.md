# Secret Management

One of the key benefits Atomist provides is management of
secrets.  Secrets are resolved per organization or *individual user* in
the event of a command handler.  This is an important capability, as
often automations all run as the same user, making for a poor audit
trail.

Secrets are injected via decorators.

For example, the following will cause an instance variable to be
populated before the `handle` method of a handler is invoked:

```typescript
@Secret(Secrets.ORG_TOKEN)
public githubToken: string;
```
